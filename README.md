sunxi-tools
-----------

Tools to help hacking Allwinner A10 (aka sun4i) ans A20 (aka sun7i) based devices
and possibly their successors, that's why the 'x' in the package name.


Building the tools
------------------
By default, the configure script will detect the buid environment and decide what set of tools to build. On an ARM platform, all the tools will be build, on any other platform, just the architecture independent tools will be build.

    ./configure
    make

You can cross-compile the tools by specifying the `--host` switch.

    ./configure --host=arm-linux-gnueabihf
    make

To build the bare-metal tools, use the '--with-baremetal' switch when running configure.

    ./configure --with-baremetal
    make


To install the tools, just do a `make install` once everything is build. To change the default installation path, use the `--prefix` switch.

    ./configure --host=arm-linux-gnueabihf --prefix=/home/user/arm-build/usr
    make
    make install

See `./configure --help` for more information on the build process and all avalable parameters.

Architecture independent tools
------------------------------
Theses tools can run natively on the device or offline on another device, they can be build for any CPU architecture.

Library dependent tools
-----------------------
Theses tools are dependent of specific libraries and will only build if the library is avalable natively on the builder system (not cross-compiling).

###sunxi-fel
script interface for talking to the FEL USB handler built into the CPU. You activate FEL mode by pushing the usboot/recovery button at poweron. See http://linux-sunxi.org/FEL/USBBoot for a detailed usage guide.

    Usage: tmp/usr/bin/sunxi-fel [options] command arguments... [command...]
      -v, --verbose                   Verbose logging
      -p, --progress                  "write" transfers show a progress bar
    
        spl file                        Load and execute U-Boot SPL
                        If file additionally contains a main U-Boot binary
                        (u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin), this command also transfers that
                        to memory (default address from image), but won't execute it.
    
        uboot file-with-spl             like "spl", but actually starts U-Boot
                        U-Boot execution will take place when the fel utility exits.
                        This allows combining "uboot" with further "write" commands
                        (to transfer other files needed for the boot).
        
        hex[dump] address length        Dumps memory region in hex
        dump address length             Binary memory dump
        exe[cute] address               Call function address
        read address length file        Write memory contents into file
        write address file              Store file contents into memory
        write-with-progress addr file   "write" with progress bar
        write-with-gauge addr file      Output progress for "dialog --gauge"
        write-with-xgauge addr file     Extended gauge output (updates prompt)
        multi[write] # addr file ...    "write-with-progress" multiple files,
                                        sharing a common progress status
        multi[write]-with-gauge ...     like their "write-with-*" counterpart,
        multi[write]-with-xgauge ...    but following the 'multi' syntax:
                                        <#> addr file [addr file [...]]
        echo-gauge "some text"          Update prompt/caption for gauge output
        ver[sion]                       Show BROM version
        clear address length            Clear memory
        fill address length value       Fill memory
